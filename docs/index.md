The Sickle Cell Disease Ontology [(SCDO)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/scdo) project is a collaboration between H3ABioNet (Pan African Bioinformatics Network) and SPAN (Sickle Cell Disease Pan African Network).

The [SCDO](https://scdontology.h3abionet.org/) currently represents the largest knowledge base for SCD and other hemoglobinopathies. It serves as a comprehensive source of SCD knowledge and provides a standardized and structured vocabulary system describing SCD concepts consistently for research and clinical applications. 

The purpose of the [SCDO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/scdo) is to:

- establish community standardized SCD terms and descriptions.
- establish canonical and hierarchical representation of knowledge on SCD.
- link to other ontologies and bodies of work such as DO, PhenX MeSH, ICD, NCIâ€™s thesaurus, SNOMED and OMIM.

The [SCDO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/scdo) aims to be/to:

- the most comprehensive collection of knowledge in the SCD.
- facilitate exploration of new scientific questions and ideas.
- facilitate seamless data sharing and collaborations including meta-analysis within the SDC community.
- support the building of databasing and clinical informatics in SCD.
