The Sickle Cell Disease Ontology **SCDO** project started as a collaboration between **H3ABioNet (Pan African Bioinformatics Network)** and **SPAN (Sickle Cell Disease Pan African Network)** and has further been developed the **SADaCC (South African Data Coordinating Centre)** under the **SickleInAfrica Consortium** mandate.

The **SCDO** currently represents the largest knowledge base for SCD and other hemoglobinopathies. It serves as a comprehensive source of SCD knowledge and provides a standardized and structured vocabulary system describing SCD concepts consistently for research and clinical applications. 

The purpose of the **SCDO** is to:

- establish community standardized SCD terms and descriptions.
- establish canonical and hierarchical representation of knowledge on SCD.
- link to other ontologies and bodies of work such as DO, PhenX MeSH, ICD, NCIâ€™s thesaurus, SNOMED and OMIM.

The **SCDO** aims to be/to:

- the most comprehensive collection of knowledge in the SCD.
- facilitate exploration of new scientific questions and ideas.
- facilitate seamless data sharing and collaborations including meta-analysis within the SDC community.
- support the building of databasing and clinical informatics in SCD.
